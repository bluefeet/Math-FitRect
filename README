Math/FitRect version 0.01
=========================

This module is very simple in its content but can save much time, much like 
other simplistic modules like Data::Pager.  This module is useful for 
calculating what size you should resize images as for such things as 
thumbnails.  If you find any other uses for "fitting rectangles in to each 
other" let the author know.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
